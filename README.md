# The podcast
## The first episode
The first episode on the way home from work is where my desert began. 

I listened to a narrator burned by the sun long before he saw the sand; years of unanswered questions, doubts, fears. My demons demanded an answer. 

~I questioned church.~ It was not the first time I wrestled with religion or God. It was the first time I wrestled with the building that raised me. I went to the same church for 26 years. Surrounded by suits and ties, I nearly broke down. That metro ride home, I questioned church. 

## Episode 2 - 4
Each was a spiritual journey. The old me wants to write a paragraph on each episode. The old me would have needed ~to write~ a book. The old me wants to convince you. The old me doubted everything I believed. 

> And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.   
> Philippians 4:7   

Philippians 4:7 is a sampling of what I wrestled with my entire life. I never doubted 4:7. 

4:7 is what I prayed for everyday. I have attended church for 26 years and I do not know how to pray. 

**WTF** is peace that surpasses all understanding? What is something that can not be explained? If **YOU** can not explain it to **ME**, your idea is not **REAL** 

> The piece that surpasses all   

I feel this piece; it surpasses all.

> understanding  

I have peace that I do not understand. 

## The last episode
In the last episode I am the narrator. The spiritual journey talked about in episode 5 is the journey I have been on. I have not finished episode 5, I fear its ending. 

## One next step
Everything has changed; all my next steps are new. I will meditate next. @exbinary, I donâ€™t know how, will you teach me?
